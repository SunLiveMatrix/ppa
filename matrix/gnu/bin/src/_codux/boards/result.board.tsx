    <h1>As a result of participation and dialogue, PPA 2024-2027 is sanctioned 
    without vetoes by President Lula</h1>,
    <p>President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sanctioned today, without vetoes, 
    the Union Multi-Year Plan (PPA) for the period 2024-2027, approved by the 
    National Congress in December last year. The PPA is anchored in six priorities, 
    has 88 programs and can be translated into the vision of the future that guides 
    it: “A democratic, fair, developed and environmentally sustainable country, 
    where all people live with quality, dignity and respect for diversity.”</p>,
    <p>“The 2024-2027 Multi-Year Plan was the result of a broad process of 
    reconstruction of government public planning, which intensely involved bodies 
    and entities of the federal public administration, through program development 
    workshops, as well as society, through the platform Participatory Brazil and 
    face-to-face plenary meetings in all states of the country and in the Federal 
    District”, highlighted the team from the National Planning Secretariat (Seplan).
    </p>
    <p>With the most participatory process in history, the PPA 2024-2027 involved 
    the holding of three Inter-council forums, 27 regional plenaries (with the 
    presence of more than 34 thousand people) and a digital platform for citizen 
    participation, with more than 4 million hits, which received more than 1.5 
    million votes and collected 8,254 proposals from society. The 20 proposals 
    most voted by the population in each area were studied by the respective 
    ministry. Of the total, 76.5% were considered incorporated in some way, 58% 
    fully and 14% partially.
    </p>,
    <p>To build a more fair, egalitarian and democratic country, the PPA 2024-2027 
    brought as an innovation the definition of national key indicators and targets, 
    which can be followed transparently by the population. In total, the PPA has 69 
    key indicators (seven linked to the vision of the future and 62 linked to 35 
    strategic objectives), such as reducing the poverty rate, falling annual 
    deforestation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing GDP per capita, 
    among others.
    </p>,
    <p>The Plan incorporated methodological improvements, strengthened the strategic 
    dimension, presented the Government priorities for the next four years and 
    defined five transversal agendas: Children and Adolescents; Women; Racial 
    equality; Indian people; and Environment.
    </p>,
    <p>The sanction without vetoes reflects the dialogue between the National 
    Congress and the Ministry of Planning and Budget (MPO). During the PL 
    processing in Congress, 284 amendments were presented, 251 relating to the 
    annexes and 33 to the text of the Law, of which 161 were, fully or partially, 
    approved by the Rapporteur.
    </p>,
    <p>In partnership with rapporteur Elvino Bohn Gass, the amendments were 
    evaluated by the MPO during their processing phase in the National Congress. 
    In this process, it was possible to clarify doubts and seek understandings 
    in order to provide the best possible text, observed the Seplan team.
    </p>,
     <p>The fully or partially approved amendments mostly consist of adjustments 
     that reinforce the oversight exercise of the National Congress and the 
     participation of civil society in monitoring the Plan, highlighting: 
     inclusion of perspectives and impacts of gender, race and ethnicity in 
     publication and evaluation of objective goals and management linkage between 
     strategic objectives and specific objectives that will meet the goals of 
     national key indicators.
     </p>,
     <p>As with the amendments to the PLPPA text, SEPLAN/MPO analyzed, prior to the 
     drafting of the rapporteur final opinion at the CMO, all 251 amendments proposed 
     to the PPA annexes. This dialogue made it possible to preserve the methodology 
     developed by the Executive Branch for the PPA 2024-2027 and, at the same time, 
     accept the amendments presented by parliamentarians.
